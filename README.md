# US Congressional District GEOJSON Fetcher
Test project to grab geojson of certain US states and counties from a GitHub geojson library.
A successful result takes in a valid state or state and county and returns a geojson of the borders.

You need to manually put in what district you want and the state that you're in.
The currente database that it is grabbing from is out-of-date however!

Todo: check for errors, create a list of all valid responses?
